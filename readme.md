This is the final project of C programming language. This project is developed using C programming language. The main agenda of the project is to develop a Hospital management system which is able to records patient and doctors’ information such as identity, name, address, disease and date of patient admission, doctors’ specialization. As well as can be modified as per the necessity of the user. 
In this program, when we will compile the program using gcc m.c -o m. After the program runs, then the following information will be displayed. 
 
 Then the user should choose the option by entering any number between 0 and 5.
 For example, If I input 1 which represents “to add newly admitted patient” then program will ask for the patient identity, patient name, patient address, disease.
  
After the user enters the information will be saved. So, to access the saved information, the user needs to input 2 which will display the list of patients. 
 
In this program, we can also delete the name of the patient. We need to input 3 which represents discharge of the patient and then we need to input the Identity number. 
 
After that If we click on patient list then we won’t be able to see the record
